   <div class="backgroundsect"><h1>About This Website</h1>
     <p>Although this website may be fairly new, our history extends way back to prehistoric
     times, when man first discovered fire. Grill!! Grill!! Grill!! has been our motto since the very first day, the sweet succulent smell of fresh marinated meat on the sizzling hot fire always
   seems to be the reason for our pure peace, harmony and serenity.<br><br>
   Every single day, we receive fresh vegetables, meat and groceries with which we prepare our
   world renound grilled food, because grilling is not just another method of cooking... It's a way of life!!!
   <br><br>
   So if you feel you are not getting the value you deserve, we will make sure to please you
   no matter which costs...why? Simply because we value you, without our customers, there wouldn't
     be anything at all. Therefore your meal will be on the house.
